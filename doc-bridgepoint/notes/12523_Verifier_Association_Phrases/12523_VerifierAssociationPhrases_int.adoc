= 12523 Verifier Association Phrases

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

Verifier was observed to incorrectly display relationship phrases in 
Session Explorer when showing participant instances in reflexive associations.  


== 2 Introduction and Background

Details of the incorrect behavior are captured here: <<dr-3>>.

== 3 Requirements

 Reflexive association phrases shall be displayed correctly.
 

== 4 Work Required

Study the Verifier code implementing association linkages to 
understand the erroneous behavior and correct it.

== 5 Implementation Comments

On examination, the code implementing association 'relate' in Verifier was 
found to be poorly designed and overly complex. In particular, the 
implementation was observed to make little use of downward navigation 
from the Association data structures, opting instead to attempt multiple 
upward navigations from the statement variables.

Further examination revealed that the issue was deeper than just incorrect 
phrase labeling in Verifier's Session Explorer. Associations are realized 
in Verifier by a data structure (in the Instance Package) which explicitly 
considers an association to have a preferred 'forward' direction. This concept 
appears to be modeled on the R_RGO (from), and R_RTO,(to), subtypes of R_OIR 
when a relationship is formalized. (See Association package].

Verifier explicitly implements an association via two separate associations 
between the participant instance representatives (Link Participation) and the 
instance (Link) which realizes the association.  These are R2901, for the 
'from' participant; R2902, for the 'to' participant.

The code for 'Relate(_Using)::execute and Unrelate(_Using)::execute, under some 
circumstances, improperly swapped the use of these associations. This not only 
results in incorrect association phrase display, but can introduce false errors 
when population consistency is monitored. (The fact that the two associations may 
be used incorrectly is masked by the fact that both 'Relate' and 'Unrelate' share 
similar convoluted and incorrect code).


=== 5.1 The heart of the issue.

The challenge is to correctly identify the 'direction' of an association being 
related, with respect to the ordering of the participant instances in the 
'relate' statement.

When a simple association is formalized, this is readily done, as the Association data 
structure distinguishes between the 'formalizer' and the 'participant'.

In the case of a reflexive association, both participants are of the same class; 
it is necessary to discriminate between 'from' and 'to' participants by 
comparing the required relationship phrase used in the 'relate' statement to the 
required phrases held by the association data structure. 

In the case of unformalized associations, however, it may not be readily easy to 
distinguish between the two 'participant' (R_PART instances) representing the 
'source' and 'destination' variables - as in "relate source to destination".

A pragmatic approach is to arbitrarily select the first of the two R_PART instances 
as retrieved from a 'select many' followed by a 'for each' as the 'from' part; 
the second as the 'to'. This, in the context of Verifier's execution 
engine, at least, provides a repeatable means to discern the 'direction' of a 
'Relate' or 'Unrelate' statement.

If the unformalized association is phrased , and the statement uses 
a (non-required) phrase, the 'direction' of the statement can be determined 
by comparing the statement phrase with the arbitrary 'from' part.

An unformalized reflexive must have, and must use, phrases; use these to determine 
the 'direction' of the statement.

If the non-reflexive association has no declared phrases - and the statement, 
therefore cannot use a phrase - it would seem that it matters not in which order 
the links are established; 


=== 5.2 The implementation changes.

The code was greatly simplified by making use of Association data structure information 
where simple associations are formalized. It proved convenient to swap the order of the 
source and destination variables when a 'backward' relate was identified - i.e. when the 
'participant' variable came first in the statement. This simplified the logic when 
validating multiplicity and also when establishing the linkages which implement the association.

While not strictly necessary as part of this work, the code for associative relationships 
shared the poor design noted above; it was deemed appropriate to overhaul this while having a 
clear and current understanding of what was needed.

The function used to supply the relationship phrase for display, which relied on the 'unreliable' 
R2901/2 associations was slightly modified to match the code changes to the relationship.

The reason for creation of a useless Link Participation at each class instance creation, 
[ Instance::initialize ] for each relationship in which the instance class might participate 
escapes this analyst; its removal shows no ill-effects.. and greatly helped debugging this 
code morass.

Note:
The phrases for R2901/2 are not well chosen; the original mcooa phrases were better.
The attributes in Link class that formalize those two associations are poorly named.
The potential disruption involved in unformalizing/reworking/reformalizing the two 
associations is deemed not worth the time; anybody who needs to understand what is 
involved here should research this implementation note.

== 6 Unit Test

The simple test model supplied in the original issue was used to validate the code change,
and updated with several tests to validate that the changes did not introduce errors in 
relationships other than reflexives. Several specific tests were added to address suspect 
behaviors. The updated code tested correctly against two substantial applications.

== 7 User Documentation

None: this work merely corrected erroneous behavior.
